A Smart Irrigation System using a Raspberry Pi. This is my entry to the Farnell Element14 'Mixing Electronics and Water' held Spring 2018. The aim of E14's competition is to use electronics in a way that can help save water. Search https://www.element14.com for details.

The idea for this project is that the Pi can access the WWW and more specifically a weather API. I've chosen the MetOffice's site as I live in the UK and it seemed quite simple to get started (I've never really done much with Python nor APIs/JSON before). The API returns JSON data to the Pi about the upcoming weather. I will try and make a sensible algorithm in there to determine if the irrigation system waters the plants or not. 

Such a system would likely not be too useful in places where water is plentiful or from mains supplies - however I think it will be really useful if the water is perhaps roof run off to a water barrel. This should prevent watering the plants and using the barrel's supply up when the next day is is probably going to rain anyway.

Code is provided without restrictions for using on your own projects, modifying or repurposing. However a link or acknowlegment would be appreciated.
